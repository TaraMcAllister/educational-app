# Questions

I have decided to create questions for the different lessons within the modules. Partially to have real content to put into my mockups but also because I would love to build an Amazon Alexa Game for 'desrupt.' I think it would be a valuable learning resource as well as bringing a USP to 'desrupt.' Users of 'desupt' could test their skills and knowledge while getting ready for work or eating breakfast in the morning.

I will need to create at least 7 questions for every lesson in order to bring real educational value to the lesson. I feel any less would be futile.
