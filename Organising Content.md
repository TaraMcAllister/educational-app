# Creating Content

My app will allow users to click the learning topics that interest them most and will then build a custom learning path for them based on this, starting with vital knowledge first.

I need to organise the content that the users will be consuming, creating Module names and lessons for within the modules.

I have decided to layout my thought-process and link all websites that have helped build my course content as I am a big believer in **transparency.**

## What topics do designers need to know?

This entirely depends on what field of design they inhabit. My app must be able to provide quality, free education for a wide variety of designers. I do not want my app to only function well for UX or for Illustrators.

I want to start with writing down all the topics that I feel are pivotal within the design field, researching other design courses content and reading industry professional's articles about what topics they feel are necessary, in order to get a wide scope and not miss something interesting.

Now, I think thats the bases, that is the main modules (and some lessons for within.) I also need to think about what tasks will be given in each module. Time to organise.

The tasks allow the users to create pieces based on the knowledge they are gaining, get real feedback for them, gain rewards and also have portfolio pieces!

## Organising Content 
*Warning: This is not in chronological order. This is my own brain-thinking order.*

### Fundamentals
Maybe a section that everyone across all learning paths completes. Some select core knowledge that all paths will need to suceed?

Ideas:
* Colour theory; traditional colour theory however also including tone, shade and using contrast to create accessible products.
* Accessibile design across mediums
* Finding Inspiration 
* Creative Confidence (A big problem with most creative people is creative confidence. Teaching this early and as a fundamental is vital!!! This could help app users see their value, and the value of their work from early in the process, building an important foundation.)
* Using social media (Teaching designers how to get their work, and themselves out there as a fundamental would be pretty interesting. This could also help people spread the word about the app!)
* Branding yourself and Positioning
* Pricing

Task: Set-up social medias and position yourself.

### Typography
I have decided that typography should be it's own module and be quite high-up in all the paths that relate to typography as it can make and break designs. A good typographic base is fundamental in the design process.

#### Typography Basics

Lessons:
* Terminology
* Typography across the ages

#### Typography for the Web and Interfaces

Lessons:
* Type hierachy on the web
* Accessible type
* User Reading habits (user attention spans, how users scan on the web etc - https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/)
* Using standard fonts
* Line-length

Task: Layout type hierarchy within web context

#### Breaking the Rules
Inspired by Paula Schmer I added this module as I don't want to encourage designers to all fit the mould and stick to a rigid set of rules. While accessibility is important I don't want to encourage designers on this course to create bland items.

I don't know what lessons could be in this module, maybe this module just contains a lesson on Paula Schmer, a lesson on breaking the typographic grid, a lesson where we just show them examples of some typographic pieces that broke the rules (as inspiration) and then a *Task:* Create a piece that breaks the typographic rules. This piece can be as big or small as you want, and say anything (a lot or a little.)

Task: Create a Paula Scher inspired piece - anything you want.
