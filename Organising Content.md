# Creating Content

My app will allow users to click the learning topics that interest them most and will then build a custom learning path for them based on this, starting with vital knowledge first.

I need to organise the content that the users will be consuming, creating Module names and lessons for within the modules.

I have decided to layout my thought-process and link all websites that have helped build my course content as I am a big believer in **transparency.**

## What topics do designers need to know?

This entirely depends on what field of design they inhabit. My app must be able to provide quality, free education for a wide variety of designers. I do not want my app to only function well for UX or for Illustrators.

I want to start with writing down all the topics that I feel are pivotal within the design field, researching other design courses content and reading industry professional's articles about what topics they feel are necessary, in order to get a wide scope and not miss something interesting.

* UX 
* UI
* Typography
* Colour Theory
* HTML
* CSS
* Wireframing/Prototyping
* User testing
* User research
* Illustration
* Branding
* Content Strategy
* SEO
* Information Architecture
* Interaction Design
* Usability Testing
* Design Thinking
* Graphic Design
* Copywriting
* Data Visualisation
* Iconography
* Lettering
* Human-Centred Design Process
* Competitor Analysis
* Finding Inspiration 
* Mobile-first design
* Design documentation
* Getting yourself out there, "creative confidence"?
* Branding yourself
* Pricing and positioning


Webpages that helped me build this list:
[Oz Chen's list of 5 UX topics for beginners to know for UXBeginner.com] https://www.uxbeginner.com/ultimate-list-of-ux-topics-all-beginners-should-know/
[ixdbelfast Cirriculum] http://ixdbelfast.org/
[CareerFoundry's UX Designer Course Content] https://careerfoundry.com/en/course/become-a-ux-designer/course-plan

Now, I think thats the bases, that is the main modules (and some lessons for within.) So I need to organise.

## Organising Content 

### Fundamentals
Maybe a section that everyone across all learning paths completes. Some select core knowledge that all paths will need to suceed?

Ideas:
* Colour theory; traditional colour theory however also including tone, shade and using contrast to create accessible products.
* Accessibile design across mediums
* Finding Inspiration 

### Typography
I have decided that typography should be it's own module and be quite high-up in all the paths that relate to typography as it can make and break designs. A good typographic base is fundamental in the design process.

#### Typography Basics
Lessons:
* 

### UX

### UI 

#### UI Basics
Lessons:

#### Training Your Eye Game ?
* An interactive right/wrong game that reinforces the fundamentals learnt with vast visual examples, inspired by [Jony Ive's game] https://cantunsee.space/
